use g++ to compile

g++ DNA_Align.cpp main.cpp - o executable

./executable dnafile1.txt dnafile2.txt for a simple test run 

I have created two versions of DNA_Align.cpp

1. DNA_Align.cpp generates the alignment sequence as well as the score. The output file generated for each run is output.txt. You need to manually copy to new filenames to avoid overwriting.

2. DNA_Align_Score_only.cpp generates only the score. The output file generated for each run is score.txt. You need to manually copy to new filenames to avoid overwriting.


The DNA files used to compute the DNA alignment are as follows:

I have created 4 python scripts as follows:

createTable.py : creates DNA_distance_table_intrahuman.txt for Problem2
createTable_Human_Great_Apes.py : creates DNA_Distance_Table_Human_Great_Apes.txt for Problem 3
createfiles_Human_Great_Apes.py : creates the alignment files for Problem 3

automate_assignment.py : calls the first three python scripts to automatically step through all the problems. The total runtime is around 1 hour.

To execute atomically, follow the first 3 lines. 

I am submitting the following files ( input DNA files obtained after cleaning the ORIGIN files and output files generated by running the script)

Input Files

score_scheme.txt : Gap distances for different combinations of DNA string values

Problem1 : homosapiens_neanderthalensis_mitochondrion.txt
	   homosapiens_mitochondrion.txt

Problem2 : Algeria_EF064321.txt 
	   Armenia_AM263183.txt
	   Chinese_AF346972.txt
           Egypt_EF060316.txt 
	   Fillipino_AF382012.txt
	   Japanese_AF346989.txt
	   Morocco_AF381983.txt
	   Native_American_AY195748.txt
	   Navajo_AY195787.txt
	   South_American_Guarani_AF346984.txt

Problem3 : prototypical_human_sequence.txt
	   baboon_Y18001.txt
           Bonobo_D38116.txt
           Chimpanzee_D38113.txt
           Chimpanzee_X93335.txt
           Gorilla_D38114.txt
           Gorilla_Western_Lowland_X93347.txt



The files obtained for the three problems are as follows:

Problem1 : human_neanderthal_mitochondria_alignment.txt

Problem2 : DNA_distance_table_intrahuman.txt

Problem3 : baboon_Y18001_alignment.txt
	   Bonobo_D38116_alignment.txt
	   Chimpanzee_D38113_alignment.txt
	   Chimpanzee_X93335_alignment.txt
	   Gorilla_D38114_alignment.txt
	   Gorilla_Western_Lowland_X93347_alignment.txt
	   DNA_Distance_Table_Human_Great_Apes.txt


The output files generated were manually aligned as the names of the input DNAs are of varied length. There may be a way to smoothly align the parsed file but I am still not familiar with it.

Thank You
