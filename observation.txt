The DNA Alignment algorithm works correctly for all the sequences.

Time taken to align a pair of DNA sequence is around 1.5 minutes

This is because the algorithm is solving in O(n^2) time complexity.

However the major drawback of this algorithm is the space complexity.

As the DNA sequences are extremely long, the Cache generated for each computation is massive in volume.

Another observation is that all the computations give a distance of roughly 84,000 .

This is maybe because there is a lot of similarity in the DNA sequences across different races of humans and also across different species of humans vs Great Apes.
